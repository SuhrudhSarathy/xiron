Firstly, it is aimed to reduce the entry barrier to the field of Robotics by proiving an easy to use 2D simulator. Secondly, it is intended to provide a fast and light weight simulator to test and prototype navigation algorithms without the use of realistic simulations. Inspiration The inspiration to develop Xiron came from a basic need to setup up quick simulations. There were limited simulators that were independent of ROS and had a simple Python interface that fit my use case. Additionally, I wanted to learn more about the Rust Programming Langauge and ended up using it for the project. Great Alternatives Some great alternatives that provide simple 2D robot simulations 1. Flatland Simulator : Perfromat 2D simulator developed by Avidbots Corp 2. Pyrobosim : Pyrobosim is a ROS 2 enabled 2D mobile robot simulator for behavior prototyping. Overview User Guide: Configuration GUI usage Python Interface Advanced Usage Customising Robot Model Multi Robot Usage Contributions Feel free to contribute to the project. Take a look at the Contributor's Guide for more information.","title":"Home"},{"location":"#getting-started-with-xiron","text":"xiron is a light weight 2D Robot Simulator written entirely in the Rust Programming language . xiron was intended to be used for two purposes.
